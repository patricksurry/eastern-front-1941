How to play
---

You can learn to play Eastern Front 1941 by reading
the glossy [cartridge insert](Eastern_Front_1941_Atari_Cartridge.pdf)
and checking out the illustrated [mapboard](Eastern_Front_1941_Atari_poster_text.pdf).
There's more background on game mechanics and history in the original
[APX user guide](playing.md) which I extracted with OCR and annotated
from [this PDF](APX_Eastern_Front_1941.pdf).

How it works
---

Chris Crawford's annotated [APX implementation notes](howitworks.md)
explain how the original game was built, along with his reflections on the development process.
Again these were extracted and annotated from a [PDF original](APX_Source_Code_for_Eastern_Front_1941_rev_2.pdf)
which also includes scanned source assembly listings.
I transferred most of the source code notes into the machine-readable [APX disassembly](../reference/apxdump.asm).

I've collected my own [notes](notes.md) as I made various discoveries and implementation decisions for the Typescript port.  Also see the source [README](../src/README.md) for high-level organization of the new code.
